# ukusormus.com

A personal website, based on [11ty + Netlify CMS boilerplate](https://github.com/danurbanowicz/eleventy-netlify-boilerplate) by Dan Urbanowicz & community.

Migrating over from https://uku-bio.vercel.app/ (Next.js), because why make life harder?

Currently implementing a Next.js-like router for myself, for the *smooth experience*.
Pardon my CSS.
